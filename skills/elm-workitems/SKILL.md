# ELM Work Items — CCM / RTC / EWM

## Purpose

Manage work items in an IBM ELM **CCM** (RTC / EWM) project area: find them, read them,
create tasks and stories, build parent/child hierarchy, assign owners, plan them into
iterations, set custom fields, and move them through their workflow. Covers:
`list_workitems`, `get_workitem`, `create_workitem`, `update_workitem`,
`add_child_workitem`, `transition_workitem`, `list_iterations`, `get_plan_items`,
`inspect_workitem`.

Category, iteration and custom `rtc_ext:*` attributes vary per project area and are **not**
hardcoded — discover them first with the **`elm-discovery`** skill.

## When to use

- Query or read work items; view a backlog hierarchy with child tasks.
- Create a task or story, optionally as a child of an existing item.
- Set owner, estimate, iteration (`plannedFor`) or project-specific custom fields.
- Move an item through its workflow (start / resolve / close / reopen).

## Prerequisites

- The `elm-mcp` MCP server is registered (typically `uvx elm-mcp`).
- Credentials via `elm-mcp login` or env `ELM_URL` / `ELM_USER` / `ELM_PASSWORD`.
- For creates/updates with project-specific fields: discover them first via
  `list_types` / `list_fields` / `inspect_workitem` — see the `elm-discovery` skill,
  `docs/TOOLS.md` and `docs/USAGE.md`.

## Workflow

### Read

1. **Query.** `list_workitems(project, query=None)` runs an OSLC query; omit `query` to list,
   pass one to filter by title/type/state/iteration (see `docs/USAGE.md`). Returns
   id/title/type/status/owner inline.
2. **Read one.** `get_workitem(id)` fetches a single work item by ID.
3. **Hierarchy view.** `get_plan_items(project, plan=None, item_ids=None)` returns backlog
   items with their child tasks expanded in one call. Select by `plan` (iteration-title
   substring) or by explicit `item_ids`.
4. **Iterations.** `list_iterations(project)` lists iterations (title, dates, URI) — use a
   URI as the `planned_for` value when assigning an item to an iteration.

### Create

5. **Discover first (if you need project-specific fields).** `list_types` / `list_fields`
   for the shape and required fields; `inspect_workitem(id)` to copy concrete values
   (category, iteration, custom attributes) from a real item.
6. **Create.** `create_workitem(project, title, type="task", description=None,
   parent_id=None, owner=None, filed_against=None, custom_fields=None)`.
   `type` is `"task"` or `"story"` only. Category and iteration are auto-discovered when
   omitted; pass `filed_against` / `custom_fields` explicitly for project-specific values.
   Pass `parent_id` to create it already linked under a parent.
7. **Child item.** `add_child_workitem(parent_id, title, type="task", description=None,
   owner=None, project=...)` creates a work item linked as a child of `parent_id` — use this
   to build a backlog hierarchy under a story/epic.

### Update & transition

8. **Update fields.** `update_workitem(id, title=None, description=None, owner=None,
   estimate_hours=None, planned_for=None, custom_fields=None)` — ETag-based PUT; pass only the
   fields you want to change. Use `planned_for` (an iteration URI) to plan into a sprint.
9. **Change state.** `transition_workitem(id, action)` with `action` ∈
   `start`, `resolve`, `close`, `reopen`. **State changes go through the workflow action, not
   `update_workitem`** — you cannot set state by writing a field.

## Examples

```python
# Query / read
list_workitems(project="MY PROJECT (KEY)")
list_workitems(project="MY PROJECT (KEY)", query='dcterms:title="My Task"')
get_workitem(id="100300")

# Hierarchy view: backlog items of an iteration with child tasks expanded
get_plan_items(project="MY PROJECT (KEY)", plan="Sprint 12")

# Iterations (use a URI as planned_for)
list_iterations(project="MY PROJECT (KEY)")
# -> [{"title": "Sprint 12", "start": "...", "end": "...",
#      "uri": "https://elm.company.com/ccm/oslc/iterations/_ITERATION_OID"}, ...]

# --- Create ---
# Minimal (category + iteration auto-discovered)
create_workitem(project="MY PROJECT (KEY)", title="Implement login", type="task")

# Story with explicit, DISCOVERED project-specific fields
create_workitem(
    project="MY PROJECT (KEY)",
    title="User authentication",
    type="story",
    owner="jdoe",
    filed_against="https://elm.company.com/ccm/resource/itemOid/com.ibm.team.workitem.Category/_CATEGORY_OID",
    custom_fields={  # values discovered via list_fields / inspect_workitem, not invented
        "rtc_ext:com.example.team.workitem.attribute.severity": {
            "rdf:resource": "https://elm.company.com/ccm/oslc/enumerations/_PA_OID/.../literal.l10"
        }
    },
)

# Child task under a parent (build hierarchy)
add_child_workitem(parent_id="100300", title="Write login form", type="task")

# --- Update ---
update_workitem(id="100300", owner="jdoe", estimate_hours=16)
update_workitem(
    id="100300",
    planned_for="https://elm.company.com/ccm/oslc/iterations/_ITERATION_OID",  # from list_iterations
)

# --- Transition (workflow action, NOT update_workitem) ---
transition_workitem(id="100300", action="start")
transition_workitem(id="100300", action="resolve")
transition_workitem(id="100300", action="close")
transition_workitem(id="100300", action="reopen")
```

## Notes / Gotchas

- **`type` is only `"task"` or `"story"`** on `create_workitem` / `add_child_workitem` today.
  Other kinds (defect, risk, impediment, …) are on the roadmap, not yet supported.
- **State is a workflow action, not a field.** Use `transition_workitem(action=...)` with one
  of `start` / `resolve` / `close` / `reopen`; do not try to set state via `update_workitem`.
  The valid actions depend on the item's current state in its workflow.
- **Auto-discovery.** Category auto-discovery picks the project's first category — pass
  `filed_against` when there is more than one. Current-iteration auto-discovery prefers bounded
  iterations (with an end date) — pass `planned_for` if your sprint is not picked up.
- **`custom_fields` are project-specific.** Discover the exact attribute URIs and allowed
  values with `list_fields` / `inspect_workitem` (see `elm-discovery`) — never hardcode the
  placeholder URIs above.
- **Updates are partial and ETag-based.** Pass only the fields you want to change; the ETag is
  handled for you.
- `list_iterations` fetches details per iteration and can be slow on projects with many.
- Cross-domain OSLC links (Implements Requirement / Tested By / Affects) are planned, not yet
  available; QM (ETM) is read-only today.
