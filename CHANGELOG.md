# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `get_plan_items` tool — hierarchical sprint view returning backlog items with their child tasks expanded in a single call, selected by `item_ids` or by `plan` (iteration title substring) (#26)
- `transition_workitem` tool — move a work item through its workflow (`start`, `resolve`, `close`, `reopen`), discovering the target state from the work item's workflow actions (#25)

### Changed

- `list_workitems` requests key fields via `oslc.select` and returns `id`, `title`, `type`, `status` and `owner` inline instead of bare resource URIs (#23)

### Fixed

- Pin `mcp<2`: mcp 2.x removed `mcp.server.fastmcp`, so `elm-alm-py serve` crashed on startup with `ModuleNotFoundError` (#33)
- `create_workitem` no longer fails with HTTP 500 after an idle session: the session is refreshed before the POST, with re-authentication on 401/403 (#24)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `update_workitem` accepts `owner`, `estimate_hours`, `planned_for` and `custom_fields` (#20)
- `list_iterations` tool — list a project's sprints/releases with title, start/end dates and URI (#11)
- `docs/USAGE.md` with working OSLC query patterns, examples and known limitations (#13)

### Changed

- README rewritten to cover write operations, `custom_fields` and OSLC details

### Fixed

- Current-iteration discovery picks the iteration whose start/end dates contain today, preferring bounded iterations over open-ended ones (#19)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-22

Tagged but not published to PyPI (package version was not bumped); these changes first shipped in 0.3.0.

### Fixed

- `create_workitem` POSTs directly to the project's `/ccm/oslc/contexts/{projectAreaId}/workitems` endpoint instead of relying on creation-factory discovery (#15, #17)
- Extract `projectAreaId` correctly from project URLs ending in `/workitems/services.xml`

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-22

Tagged but not published to PyPI (package version was not bumped); these changes first shipped in 0.3.0.

### Added

- `custom_fields` parameter on `create_workitem` for project-specific RDF fields
- `create_workitem` sets `plannedFor` to the project's current iteration automatically

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Correct creation factory selection by work item type — no longer picks wrong factory (e.g., defect instead of task) (#7)
- Auto-discover default category (filedAgainst) for create_workitem when not provided (#8)
- Use RDF/XML format (application/rdf+xml) for resource creation POST instead of JSON (#9)

### Changed

- Remove all hardcoded organization-specific references from README, code, tests, and docs
- ELM URL is now fully configurable via ELM_URL env var or ~/.elm_creds.json (no default)
- Bump actions/checkout from 4 to 6, actions/setup-python from 5 to 6, astral-sh/setup-uv from 4 to 7, github/codeql-action from 3 to 4

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Write operations** for CCM work items:
  - `create_workitem` — create task/story with parent, owner, description
  - `update_workitem` — update title/description via OSLC PUT with ETag
  - `add_child_workitem` — convenience wrapper for creating children
- OSLC CreationFactory discovery for CCM domain
- ETag-based optimistic locking on updates
- Error handling tests for HTTP 400/401/409/412

### Fixed

- RM (DOORS Next): support Discovery 1.0 namespace in catalog + /views query endpoint
- QM (ETM): fallback to XML when JSON returns 406
- CCM (RTC): derive /services endpoint from catalog URL (was failing on services.xml)
- Handle query_base URLs with existing query parameters (RM projectURL)

### Added

- AGENTS.md with domain-specific OSLC patterns documented
- MEMORY.md for session handoff
- CodeQL security scanning workflow
- Dependabot for pip + github-actions
- Publish workflow (PyPI trusted publisher on tag push)
- pytest-cov with 60% threshold (cli.py excluded)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Initial implementation: MCP server for IBM ELM via OSLC REST
- 6 tools: list_projects, search_requirements, get_requirement, list_workitems, get_workitem, search_testcases
- Jazz form-based authentication with cookie management
- OSLC service discovery (rootservices → catalog → ServiceProvider → QueryCapability)
- CLI with `login` (credential setup) and `serve` (MCP stdio) commands
- Auto-load credentials from `~/.elm_creds.json` with base64 decode
- Support for ELM 7.0.3 OSLC namespaces (v1 + v2 fallback)
- Comprehensive test suite with respx mocking (21 tests)
- CI: GitHub Actions (ruff lint + pytest on Python 3.10-3.13)
